# Student Management app for Leidos interview By Austin Lukaschewski

## Getting started
- Install dependencies running `pnpm i` in the command prompt
- Start the application by running `pnpm start`

## Notes
- Generated this project using NX
- I used Angular Material (styling framework), TailwindCSS (CSS framework), and lodash.
- src/lib folder is is a semi-organized library-type folder. It consists of common (things used throughout the app), students, and courses.
- src/app is where the main app is. Components folder with a few layout components and a pages folder where my pages components live.
- src/types is where my typings are.
- src/styles is all of the styling files. I used a generic Angular Material theme that I setup using the custom option in the schematic.
